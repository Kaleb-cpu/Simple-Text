  <h1>Wiki-Wikipedia markup</h1>
  <h2>Wikinode</h2>
<p><i>"WikiNode" redirects here. For the app for the Apple iPad, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiNodes">WikiNodes.</a></i></p>
<p>WikiNodes are pages on wikis that describe related wikis. They are usually organized as neighbors and delegates. A neighbor wiki is simply a wiki that may discuss similar content or may otherwise be of interest. A delegate wiki is a wiki that agrees to have certain content delegated to that wiki.[48] One way of finding a wiki on a specific subject is to follow the wiki-node network from wiki to wiki; another is to take a Wiki "bus tour", for example: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:TourBusStop">Wikipedia's Tour Bus Stop.</a></p>
<h2>Participants</h2>
<p>The four basic types of users who participate in wikis are reader, author, wiki administrator and system administrator. The system administrator is responsible for the installation and maintenance of the wiki engine and the container web server. The wiki administrator maintains wiki content and is provided additional functions about pages (e.g. page protection and deletion), and can adjust users' access rights by, for instance, blocking them from editing.[49]</p>
<h2>Growth factors</h2>
<p>A study of several hundred wikis showed that a relatively high number of administrators for a given content size is likely to reduce growth;[50] that access controls restricting editing to registered users tends to reduce growth; that a lack of such access controls tends to fuel new user registration; and that higher administration ratios (i.e. admins/user) have no significant effect on content or population growth.[51]</p>
